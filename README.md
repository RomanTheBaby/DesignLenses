# Game Design Lenses
This is my small iOS that I made some time ago and will probably never support again. 

# Build and run
To build and run this project you need to have macOS and Xcode installed. After, install [cocopods](https://cocoapods.org) go to terminal and run `pod install`. That's it, the project is ready to be launched o the simulator or on the real device

# Lenses
For this app I took lenses from Jesse Shell book called: "The art of Game-Design: A book of lenses" or something like that
